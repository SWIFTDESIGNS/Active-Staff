# Active-Staff
This script will allow staff to notify everyone in game that there are staff on as well as logging the user's time,date they went active in the chosen discord channel

Commands:
/in This will notify the player that have gone active staff then waiting 3 seconds before letting the chat know the user has become active staff.

/out The same except telling them that they are no longer active staff.

This is only the first version and i do have many more idea's for the next version, i do hope that people do see the potential of this as i did.
